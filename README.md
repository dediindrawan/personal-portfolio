# personal-portfolio
A responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML5, Sass, and JavaScript. It incorporates the concept of a JSON API, where data is stored in a JSON file and then delivered to the website using JavaScript.

The website showcases various content describing personal profile, hard and soft skills, resume, portfolio, blog videos, and also a contact form that enables users to compose messages and send them directly to a predefined email address using a third-party service, namely email.js. Hyperlinks are implemented for the telephone number and email address displayed in the contact card section, allowing them to be accessed directly when clicked.

Each page also includes several basic meta data tags for additional settings such as SEO, Open Graph, and search engine indexing.

For example: 

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dedi Indrawan</title>
    <!-- information handling referer on http request -->
    <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
